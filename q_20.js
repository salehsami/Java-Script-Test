// 20. Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything
//     else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.

// let country = []
// let num = prompt("How many entries do you want to enter: ")
// for (let i = 0; i < num + 1; i++) {
//     console.log("enter an entry")
//     country.append()
// }
