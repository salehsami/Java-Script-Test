// 40. Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds a Object
//     describing a music album. The function should take in an artist name and an
//     album title, and it should return a Object containing these two pieces of
//     information. Use the function to make three dictionaries representing different
//     albums. Print each return value to show that Objects are storing the
//     album information correctly.
//     Add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you to store the
//     number of tracks on an album. If the calling line includes a value for the number
//     of tracks, add that value to the albumâ€™s Object. Make at least one new
//     function call that includes the number of tracks on an album.
