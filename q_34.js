// 34. Pizzas: Think of at least three kinds of your favorite pizza. Store these
//     pizza names in a array, and then use a for loop to print the name of each pizza.

// • Modify your for loop to print a sentence using the name of the pizza
// instead of printing just the name of the pizza. For each pizza you should
// have one line of output containing a simple statement like I like pepperoni
// pizza.
// • Add a line at the end of your program, outside the for loop, that states
// how much you like pizza. The output should consist of three or more lines
// about the kinds of pizza you like and then an additional sentence, such as
// I really love pizza!
